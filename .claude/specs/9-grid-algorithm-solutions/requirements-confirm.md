## Current Implementation Analysis

From code analysis, the current implementation has:

1. **Distributed Clustering Algorithm** (lines 1361-1499)
   - Phase 1: Gather orbs near target region
   - Phase 2: Arrange grid using 8+1 strategy
   - Issues: Complex path generation, validation failures

2. **Targeted Algorithm** (lines 928-1241)  
   - Finds possible 9-grid targets
   - Estimates steps and combos
   - Issues: Route generation not fully implemented

3. **Multiple Helper Methods**
   - Cross-targeted algorithm for plus formation
   - Path validation and conversion utilities
   - Orb movement planning functions

## Confirmed Requirements

### Core Requirements
1. **Fix existing 9-grid algorithm problems**
2. **Design multiple (N) different algorithm implementations**
3. **Test each algorithm systematically**
4. **Find solutions that satisfy 9-grid formation requirements**

### Technical Requirements
1. **Integration**: Must work with existing Pazusoba solver architecture
2. **Validation**: Must correctly form 3x3 grids of target color orbs
3. **Performance**: Must operate within reasonable step limits
4. **Reliability**: Must handle various board configurations and edge cases

### Success Criteria
1. **Correctness**: Algorithm produces valid 9-grid formations
2. **Completeness**: Works across different board sizes and orb distributions  
3. **Efficiency: Uses reasonable number of moves relative to board state
4. **Robustness**: Handles scenarios where 9-grid formation is impossible

## Next Steps
Ready to proceed with algorithm design and implementation testing phase.
